#+title: Github Oauth for wgtunnel based coder server

* Follow normal instructions for *coder server*
The instructions there will give you a local run instance of coder, with a public url available via wgtunnel.
(Usually just works, but you can host your own. Src at https://github.com/coder/wgtunnel#wgtunnel)
You can find your url by visiting http://localhost:3000/settings/deployment/general and looking under *Access URL*.
Mine for example is https://83i40cpcjt98e.try.ii.nz
* Register a new OAuth application

The [[https://coder.com/docs/v2/latest/admin/auth#github][Full Instructions]] are available, but here are my cliff notes:

Visit https://github.com/settings/applications/new and fill out the following:
- Application Name :: Hippie Hackers Personal Coder Instance
- Homepage URL :: https://83i40cpcjt98e.try.ii.nz
- Application description :: A shared workspace pair in the cloud.
- Authorization callback URL :: https://83i40cpcjt98e.try.ii.nz/api/v2/users/oauth2/github/callback

Optionally upload an Application logo.

Copy your Client ID, then click on *Generate a new client secret*.
Make sure to copy your new client secret now. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again.
* Set OAUTH variables before starting *coder server*
